The template for this app was first inspired by [this example](https://lab.arts.ac.uk/books/web-technology/page/web-app-template-for-beginners), and completed by the following resources:

- The official Socket.io [Get started](https://socket.io/get-started/chat), [Server](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-api/) and [Client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/) pages;
- The lovely tutorial by [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6b36TzJidYfIYwTFEq3K5qH).
